# LeapFamous

New UI paradigms with Leap Motion and Famo.us. Grab objects to move them on the screen!

## Setup

You'll need to install all the dependencies, so open up your terminal and type

    npm install
    bower install

Once all the components are installed, you can type 

    grunt

And then play with it on [localhost:8080].

## Interacting

LeapFamous uses a grab gesture to initiate an interaction, so close your hand once you're over an object, and then you'll be able to move it around. If you accidentally throw it off screen, just refresh to bring it back.
